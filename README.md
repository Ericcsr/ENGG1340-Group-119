## Problem setting:  
Learning English as a second language, we profoundly understand the difficulty to memorize tens of thousands of vocabularies. A traditional way to memorize vocabularies is to study the dictionary, but you may easily get bored when you can concisely predict and recite the first few words in every dictionary. Most of us will possibly give up before proceeding to last few letters like ‘s’ or ‘t’. Therefore, our product is designed to help users learn new words effectively and systematically. You will no longer be bothered by the boring alphabetical order, instead, our app will introduce new words tailored to the user, and users can even choose from 5 subjects of words that we previously stored in the “database”.

## Problem Setting:  
### In user view:  
1. Choose the category of vocabulary he/she want to memorize.
2. If the category is chosen, user can choose learning mode or revision mode of the program.
3. In learning mode user is required to input description of the word (Or multiple choices).
4. From time to time user will come across vocabularies that has shown up but failed to be memorized.
5. In revision mode user will be required to deal with  words only.
6. No matter user choose to end the program or exit the program accidentally
   user can click and resume last learning progress.
7. User can exit to the menu of choosing mode or category whenever they like.  
### In developer's view:  
1. Design interface.
2. Sort the word list of non-mastered word in a properly ranking method.
3. Insert the previous non-mastered words from mentioned list to a linked list of
   word pending to pop up from time to time.
4. Using dynamic memory allocation to minimize run time memory
5. Preserve running datas in a file and update them in real time
6. Handle input text and extract key words for explanation matching.
#### Complement:
If we find the text match is too overwhelming for us we will shift to use multiple choice questions to get user answer.
