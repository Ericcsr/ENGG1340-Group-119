##          Problem Statement:  
Learning English as a second language, we profoundly understand the difficulty to memorize tens of thousands of vocabularies. A traditional way to memorize vocabularies is to study the dictionary, but during this tedious process you can easily get lost and bored.The efficiency of memorizing those unrelated words is relatively low. Therefore, our project aims to help users learn new words effectively and systematically. You will no longer be bothered by the boring alphabetical order, our app will introduce new words tailored to the user, and users can even choose words from different subjects that we have stored in the “database”.

##          Problem Setting:  
### In user's view:  
1. Choose the category of vocabulary he/she want to memorize.
2. After the category is chosen, user can choose learning mode or revision mode.
3. In learning mode user is required to input description of the word (Or multiple choices).
4. From time to time user will come across vocabularies that has shown up but failed to be memorized.
5. In revision mode user will encounter memorized words only.
6. No matter in which way user exit the program, accidentally or by command they can always come back and resume last learning progress.
7. User can exit to the menu of choosing mode or category whenever they like.  
### In developer's view:  
1. Design interface.
2. Sort the word list of non-mastered word in a properly ranking method.
3. Insert words that have appeared but is not memorized to a linked list of
   word pending to pop up from time to time.
4. Using dynamic memory allocation to minimize run time memory
5. Store meanings and properties of the words in the database.
5. Preserve running datas in a file and update them in real time
6. Evaluate user's cognition of a word, either by asking for short descriptions or giving mutiple choice questions.
