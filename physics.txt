infrared@a kind of electromagnetic wave that humans cannot see.@The part of the electromagnetic spectrum with a longer wavelength than light but a shorter wavelength than radio waves; radiation with wavelength between 0.8 micrometres and 1 millimetre.@10@
angstorm@10 to the power of 10 meter@A unit of length equal to 10®C10 metre, used principally to express the wavelengths of electromagnetic radiations. It is equivalent to 0.1 nanometre.@10@
baryon@particles that are not lighter than proton@Any of a class of elementary particles that have a mass greater than or equal to that of the proton, participate in strong interactions, and have a spin of . Baryons are either nucleons or hyperons. The baryon number is the number of baryons in a system minus the number of antibaryons.@10@
calorie@a unit that is equal to 4.1868J@A unit of heat, equal to 4.1868 joules (International Table calorie): formerly defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by 1°„C under standard conditions. It has now largely been replaced by the joule for scientific purposes.@10@
convection@warm air rising and cold air sinking@The process by which masses of relatively warm air are raised into the atmosphere, often cooling and forming clouds, with compensatory downward movements of cooler air.@10
cyclotron@a type of particle accelerator@A type of particle accelerator in which the particles spiral inside two D-shaped hollow metal electrodes placed facing each other under the effect of a strong vertical magnetic field, gaining energy by a high-frequency voltage applied between these electrodes.@10@
fluorescence@emission of light or other radiation@The emission of light or other radiation from atoms or molecules that are bombarded by particles, such as electrons, or by radiation from a separate source. The bombarding radiation produces excited atoms, molecules, or ions and these emit photons as they fall back to the ground state.@10@
inductance@property of which an electromotive force is created by a change of current@The property of an electric circuit as a result of which an electromotive force is created by a change of current in the same circuit (self-inductance) or in a neighbouring circuit (mutual inductance). It is usually measured in henries.@10@
viscosity@quality that some liquids have of being thick and sticky@A measure of this resistance, equal to the tangential stress on a liquid undergoing streamline flow divided by its velocity gradient. It is measured in newton seconds per metre squared.@10@
superconductivity@property of zero resistance@The property of certain substances that have no electrical resistance. In metals it occurs at very low temperatures, but higher temperature superconductivity occurs in some ceramic materials.@10@
